#Perform Text Analysis to Identify Frequently Mentioned Treatments
#To analyze frequently mentioned treatments and their associated effectiveness, you can utilize full-text search capabilities or string functions available in your SQL database. 
#This example assumes a simplified approach using LIKE patterns or full-text search features for specific keywords related to treatments.

WITH TreatmentMentions AS (
  SELECT
    ArticleId,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE AbstractText LIKE '%remdesivir%') AS RemdesivirMentions,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE AbstractText LIKE '%hydroxychloroquine%') AS HydroxychloroquineMentions,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE AbstractText LIKE '%ivermectin%') AS IvermectinMentions
  FROM Articles
  GROUP BY ArticleId
)
SELECT
  SUM(RemdesivirMentions) AS TotalRemdesivirMentions,
  SUM(HydroxychloroquineMentions) AS TotalHydroxychloroquineMentions,

# Analyze Publication Trend Over Time
To identify trends in research activity related to COVID-19, group articles by their publication date and count the number of articles over time.

SELECT
  FORMAT(PublicationDate, 'yyyy-MM') AS PublicationMonth,
  COUNT(*) AS NumberOfArticles
FROM Articles
GROUP BY FORMAT(PublicationDate, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY PublicationMonth;

#Determine the Geographical Distribution of Research
Analyzing the affiliations of article authors can help identify which countries are contributing the most to COVID-19 research. 
This requires parsing the affiliations text to extract country names, which might be complex depending on the data structure.


-- Assuming we have a table that maps article authors to their affiliations and countries
WITH CountryContributions AS (
  SELECT
    Country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ArticleId) AS ArticlesCount
  FROM AuthorAffiliations
  GROUP BY Country
)
SELECT
  Country,
  ArticlesCount
FROM CountryContributions
ORDER BY ArticlesCount DESC;
