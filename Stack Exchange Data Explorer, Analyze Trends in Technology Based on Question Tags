#Analyze Trends in Technology Based on Question Tags- Stack Overflow , Stack Exchange Data Explorer 
#To analyze technology trends, you can count the number of questions associated with each technology tag per 
#year and calculate the growth rate. This involves grouping data by tag and year, then using window 
#functions to compare counts across years. To analyze technology trends over time, I constructed a query that 
#groups Stack Overflow questions by their tags and year. Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named TaggedQuestions,
#I first extracted the year from the CreationDate, the tags, and counted the number of questions per tag and year. 
#Then, in the YearlyGrowth CTE, I applied the LAG window function to get the previous year's question count for the
#same tag. This allowed me to calculate the growth rate of questions per tag from one year to the next.
#By ordering the results by growth rate, we can easily identify which technologies are gaining popularity.

WITH TaggedQuestions AS (
  SELECT
    YEAR(CreationDate) AS Year,
    Tags,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY YEAR(CreationDate), Tags) AS QuestionCount
  FROM Posts
  WHERE PostTypeId = 1 -- 1 for Questions
),
YearlyGrowth AS (
  SELECT
    Year,
    Tags,
    QuestionCount,
    LAG(QuestionCount) OVER (PARTITION BY Tags ORDER BY Year) AS PreviousYearCount,
    (CAST(QuestionCount AS FLOAT) - LAG(QuestionCount) OVER (PARTITION BY Tags ORDER BY Year)) / LAG(QuestionCount) OVER (PARTITION BY Tags ORDER BY Year) AS GrowthRate
  FROM TaggedQuestions
)
SELECT Year, Tags, QuestionCount, PreviousYearCount, GrowthRate
FROM YearlyGrowth
WHERE Year = YEAR(GETDATE()) - 1 -- Example for last year; adjust as needed
ORDER BY GrowthRate DESC;

#Determine the Answer Rate by Month-For calculating the monthly answer rate, my approach involved two CTEs: 
MonthlyQuestions and AnsweredQuestions. In MonthlyQuestions, I grouped questions by month and year, 
counting the total number of questions. In AnsweredQuestions, I joined the Posts table to itself to count 
questions that received at least one answer within the same month of posting. Finally, by joining these two CTEs,
I calculated the answer rate as the number of answered questions divided by the total questions per month. 
This query helps in understanding how responsive the Stack Overflow community is over time.
#Calculating the answer rate by month involves counting the number of questions that received at least one answer within the same month they were posted.

WITH MonthlyQuestions AS (
  SELECT
    FORMAT(CreationDate, 'yyyy-MM') AS Month,
    COUNT(*) AS TotalQuestions

),
AnsweredQuestions AS (
  SELECT
    FORMAT(Q.CreationDate, 'yyyy-MM') AS Month,
    COUNT(*) AS Answered
  FROM Posts AS Q
  JOIN Posts AS A ON Q.Id = A.ParentId AND MONTH(Q.CreationDate) = MONTH(A.CreationDate) AND YEAR(Q.CreationDate) = YEAR(A.CreationDate)
  WHERE Q.PostTypeId = 1 -- Questions
  GROUP BY FORMAT(Q.CreationDate, 'yyyy-MM')
)
SELECT
  MQ.Month,

ORDER BY MQ.Month;

#Identify Top 10 Users Who Improved Their Reputation Most-To find users with the most significant reputation 
gains in the past year, I used the UserReputationHistory table. I grouped reputation changes by UserId and year,
summing up the reputation gains. By joining this result with the Users table, I could associate the UserId with 
user display names and order the results by the highest reputation gains. This query highlights users who have 
been particularly active or helpful on the platform in the past year, showcasing the potential leaders of the
Stack Overflow community.
#To find users who have significantly improved their reputation, compare their reputation gains over the past year.

WITH ReputationGains AS (
  SELECT
    UserId,
    YEAR(CreationDate) AS Year,
    SUM(Value) AS ReputationGain -- Assuming Value is the reputation change
  FROM UserReputationHistory
  WHERE YEAR(CreationDate) = YEAR(GETDATE()) - 1
  GROUP BY UserId, YEAR(CreationDate)
)
SELECT
  U.DisplayName,
  RG.Year,
  RG.ReputationGain
FROM ReputationGains AS RG
JOIN Users AS U ON RG.UserId = U.Id
ORDER BY RG.ReputationGain DESC
LIMIT 10;
